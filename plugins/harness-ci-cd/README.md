Website: [https://harness.io/](https://harness.io/)

Welcome to the Harness NextGen CI/CD plugin for Backstage!

## Getting started

We have video tutorial for the plugin. 

[![Watch here](http://img.youtube.com/vi/XDNdInYwiuw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDNdInYwiuw)

## Setup steps

1. Open terminal and navigate to the _root of your Backstage app_. Then run

```
yarn add --cwd packages/app @harnessio/backstage-plugin-ci-cd

yarn install
```

If you are looking to get started with Backstage, check out [backstage.io/docs](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/).

For testing purposes, you can also clone this repository to try out the plugin. It contains an example Backstage app setup which is pre-installed with Harness plugins. However, you must create a new Backstage app if you are looking to get started with Backstage.

2. Configure proxy for harness in your `app-config.yaml` under the `proxy` config. Add your Harness Personal Access Token or Service Account Token for `x-api-key`. See the [Harness docs](https://docs.harness.io/article/tdoad7xrh9-add-and-manage-api-keys) for generating an API Key.

```yaml
# In app-config.yaml

proxy:
  # ... existing proxy settings
  '/harness':
    target: 'https://app.harness.io/'
    headers:
      'x-api-key': '<YOUR PAT/SAT>'
# ...
```

Note: Plugin uses token configured here to make Harness API calls. Make sure this token has the necessary permissions.

3. Inside your Backstage's `EntityPage.tsx`, update the `cicdContent` component to render `<EntityHarnessCiCdContent />` whenever the service is using Harness CI/CD. Something like this -

```tsx
// In packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx

import {
  isHarnessCiCdAvailable,
  EntityHarnessCiCdContent,
} from '@harnessio/backstage-plugin-ci-cd';

const cicdContent = (
  // ...
  <EntitySwitch.Case if={isHarnessCiCdAvailable}>
    <EntityHarnessCiCdContent />
  </EntitySwitch.Case>
  // ...
);
```

Note: If you have separate providers for CI and CD apart from Harness, you need to add a new tab for Harness CI/CD plugin like below instead of replacing your existing CI/CD tab mentioned above.

```tsx
// In packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx

import {
  isHarnessCiCdAvailable,
  EntityHarnessCiCdContent,
} from '@harnessio/backstage-plugin-ci-cd';

const serviceEntityPage = (
  // ...
  <EntityLayout.Route
    path="/harness-ci-cd"
    title="Harness CI/CD"
    if={isHarnessCiCdAvailable}
  >
    <EntityHarnessCiCdContent />
  </EntityLayout.Route>
  // ...
);
```

</details>

4. Add required harness specific annotations to your software component's respective `catalog-info.yaml` file. Here is an example: https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/blob/main/examples/catalog-harness-cicd.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  # ...
  annotations:
    # mandatory annotation
    harness.io/project-url: <harness_project_url>

    # optional annotations
    # harness.io/ci-pipelineIds: <pipelineId1,pipelineId2,pipelineId3 etc>
    # harness.io/cd-serviceId: <serviceId>
spec:
  type: service
  # ...
```

Note: Refer to [this](./PluginConfiguation.md) page on how to get these values from your Harness account.

By default, the plugin will take all the pipelines inside the configured Harness project and show their executions. However, if your service has quiet a few pipelines, you can additionally configure the pipelines as well as associated services to show those specific execution details for the display.

## Other configurations

- (Optional) Harness URL

If you have a separate Harness hosted URL other than `https://app.harness.io`, you can configure `baseUrl` for `harness` in `app-config.yaml` This step is optional. The default value of `harness.baseUrl` is https://app.harness.io/

```yaml
# In app-config.yaml

harness:
  baseUrl: https://app.harness.io/
```

- Enable/Disable re-run pipelines feature

By default, Backstage users will be able to re-run pipelines from the plugin. However, if your Backstage app doesn't have a good RBAC policy, users can technically re-run pipelines for any service. Due to this, we have a way to disable the re-run pipeline feature. You can do this by configuring `harness.disableRunPipeline`.

```yaml
# app-config.yaml

harness:
  # (Optional) Change it true to remove "Run Pipeline" option on the pipeline executions table
  disableRunPipeline: false
```

## Features

- Connect a Backstage service with a Harness project and view top 50 executions from the pipelines in the project.
- See details about executions - status, execution timestamp and time taken, associated triggers for CI pipelines, services deployed for CD pipelines.
- Specify pipeline IDs (CI) or service IDs (CD) to narrow down on pipeline executions to show in the Backstage service view.
- Retry pipeline executions from the plugin
